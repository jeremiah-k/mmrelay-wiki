If you're new to Matrix (or even if you're not!), we invite you to join our project's room at [#mmrelay:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mmrelay:matrix.org).

By following the link above, you'll be guided through the process of installing a Matrix client of your choice and directed to our main room. Although an Element web client is available, we recommend using standalone versions for a smoother experience.

These initial steps will acquaint you with Matrix's functionality and help provide a better understanding of the relay's configuration options. Once you've joined our project's room, we'll be able to assist you further.
