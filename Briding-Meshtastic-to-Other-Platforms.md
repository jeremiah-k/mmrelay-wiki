Matrix is an open standard designed to enable cross-platform communication. Thanks to the existing bridges available in the Matrix ecosystem, the Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay extends this interconnectivity to mesh networks, allowing for seamless communication between devices in the field and other platforms. With the relay, users can bridge their Meshtastic mesh networks to many other platforms supported by Matrix, including Slack, Discord, Telegram, Signal, SMS, IRC, and more.
