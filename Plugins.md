M<>M Relay functions as a message relay between Meshnets and Matrix, allowing for seamless communication across platforms. However, we're also working on a plugin system that expands the relay's capabilities. While this framework is still in development, our initial plans include implementing a `!health` command to check the status of a Meshnet and a `!seen` command to retrieve the last known location of a user or users within a Meshnet, we're also looking into ways to make use of the location data produced by the meshnets. This is just the start. We aim to introduce even more plugins in the future.

We also encourage community members to contribute their own plugins to the project, which can be easily integrated into the existing framework to enhance the relay's functionality.
