[GPX Tracker Plugin](https://github.com/fernandodpr/MMR-GPXTRacker) - The GPX Tracker plugin for Meshtastic allows you to log location data from your mesh network devices into individual GPX files. Each device's track is stored separately and organized by date, making it easy to manage and analyze location data for your devices.
