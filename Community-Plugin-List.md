## Important Note for v1.0

With the release of v1.0, community plugins may need to be updated to work with the new package structure. If you're a plugin user, check with the plugin developer for updated versions.

For plugin developers, please see the [Community Plugin Development Guide](Community-Plugin-Development-Guide.md) for information on updating your plugins for v1.0.

## Available Plugins

- **[GPX Tracker Plugin](https://github.com/fernandodpr/MMR-GPXTRacker)**  
  The GPX Tracker plugin for Meshtastic allows you to log location data from your mesh network devices into individual GPX files. Each device's track is stored separately and organized by date, making it easy to manage and analyze location data for your devices.

- **[Uptime Plugin](https://github.com/leow149/MMR-uptime)**
  Monitors the uptime of specified Meshtastic nodes. Sends alerts to a designated Matrix room if nodes exceed a configurable offline threshold and provides an uptime report on demand using the `!uptime` command.
