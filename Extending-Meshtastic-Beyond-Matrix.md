# Extending Meshtastic Beyond Matrix

Matrix is an open standard designed to enable cross-platform communication. Thanks to the existing bridges available in the Matrix ecosystem, the Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay extends this interconnectivity to mesh networks, allowing for seamless communication between devices in the field and other platforms.

Several Matrix bridges have been successfully tested with M<>M Relay, including Telegram and Discord, which work particularly well. Some users have even experimented with SMS bridges as a proof of concept, enabling Meshtastic messages to reach mobile phones without Matrix clients.

The beauty of this approach is that once your Meshtastic network is connected to Matrix, you can leverage any of the [many bridges in the Matrix ecosystem](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) to extend your mesh network's reach. This creates powerful possibilities for emergency communications, remote team coordination, and community networking projects.

For specific bridge setup instructions, we recommend starting with the well-tested options (Telegram, Discord) before exploring other bridges based on your specific needs.
