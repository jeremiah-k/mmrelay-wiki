First, download and install the [Element client](https://element.io/download) for the operating system of your choice.
_Although an Element web client is available, we recommend using standalone versions for your main Matrix account (not your bot user)._

Once Element is installed, follow [this link](https://matrix.to/#/#mmrelay:matrix.org) and then click "Continue" under the Element section and you'll be guided to the MMRelay project room.

These initial steps will help you get familiar with Matrix's basic functionality, which in turn will help provide a better understanding of the relay's configuration options. Once you've joined our project's room, we'll be able to help you further.<p><p>
