Completely new to Matrix? You'll want two accounts to use MMRelay, one for the bot and a personal account for yourself. Follow these steps to create your personal account.

## Setting Up Matrix

1. **Install a Matrix Client**:
   - Download and install the [Element client](https://element.io/download) for your operating system
   - While a web client is available, we recommend using the standalone version for your main Matrix account

2. **Create a Matrix Account**:
   - Follow the instructions in Element to create a new account
   - You can use matrix.org as your homeserver, or choose another public homeserver

3. **Join the M<>M Relay Community**:
   - Follow [this link](https://matrix.to/#/#mmrelay:matrix.org) to join our project room
   - Click "Continue" under the Element section
   - You'll be guided to the M<>M Relay project room where you can ask questions and get help

## Setting Up M<>M Relay

After your personal account is setup, you have two main installation options:

### Traditional Installation
Continue with the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/meshtastic-matrix-relay/blob/main/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md) for pip/pipx installation.

### Docker Installation (Recommended for Easy Deployment)
For containerized deployment with automatic dependency management, see the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/meshtastic-matrix-relay/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md).

Docker provides isolated environment, easy updates, and consistent deployment across different systems.
